# Neko2Telegram
 Send Telegram messaged if someone connect or leave or Neko-Room

There will be no more updates because its just a quick and dirty. just run it in background mini project of me 
to get notify if someone is joining or leaving my neko-room.

Thanks to https://github.com/manuchekhr32/send-telegram-message-with-js that he wrote the perfect wrapper already to send Telegram messages.
i just edited the bottom of his code with "module.exports = { Bot, TelegramBotSetup}"


feel free to use it but i will not be responsible for any damages
